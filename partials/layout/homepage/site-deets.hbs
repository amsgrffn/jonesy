        <h4>A Thing We Made:</br>Jewelboxing</h4>
        <p>
        We hated the options available for custom packaging DVDs and CDs so we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050301003430/http://www.jewelboxing.com/">created a brand that gives
        creative professionals and hobbyists the tools to make great stuff</a>.
        Here's a bit from the latest Jewelboxing weblog entry:
        </p>

        <p><i>"It took us almost six months to get it just exactly right but we're happy to report that all Jewelboxing orders are now shipping with <b>our new custom-milled and custom-coated paper.</b> It performs incredibly well."</i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050301003430/http://www.jewelboxing.com/blog.php">Read the entire post</a>.

        If it's not on the shelves where it belongs it's probably on Bryan's desk or
         in Susan's bag or maybe in the kitchen under a pizza box or something. <a href="library.php" target="_self">These
         are books we simply can't work without</a>. Divided by writing, design and code references.
